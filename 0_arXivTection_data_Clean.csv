A Tale of Pronouns Interpretability Informs Gender Bias Mitigation for Fairer Instruction-Tuned Machine Translation,"Recent instruction fine-tuned models can solve multiple NLP tasks when prompted to do so, with machine translation (MT) being a prominent use case. However, current research often focuses on standard performance benchmarks, leaving compelling fairness and ethical considerations behind. In MT, this might lead to misgendered translations, resulting, among other harms, in the perpetuation of stereotypes and prejudices. In this work, we address this gap by investigating whether and to what extent such models exhibit gender bias in machine translation and how we can mitigate it.","The latest trained models are able to complete various natural language processing jobs when given the proper prompts, with converting text between languages (machine translation) being a common application. However, current research frequently prioritizes performance on standard benchmarks over important fairness and ethics issues. For machine translation, this could lead to translations that incorrectly portray gender, propagating harmful stereotypes and prejudices as one result. In this paper, we tackle this deficiency by exploring if and how far such models display gender bias in machine translation and how we might reduce it.","Recently trained models can carry out multiple natural language processing tasks when instructed to, with transferring text between languages (translation) being a major use. But existing research often emphasizes scores on normal tests instead of vital fairness and moral questions. In translation, this might create translations that wrongly portray gender, spreading stereotypes and biases. Here, we address this lack by checking if these models have gender bias in translation and how to fix it.","The most recently trained models are able to do various natural language processing jobs when prompted, with converting text between languages (translation) being a key application.

We discover that IFT models default to male-inflected translations, even disregarding female occupational stereotypes.

A Tale of Pronouns Interpretability Informs Gender Bias Mitigation for Fairer Instruction-Tuned Machine Translation,"Based on attribution interpretability, we find that models systematically ignore the pronoun (and thus, the conveyed gender information) when producing misgendered translations.

ALDi Quantifying the Arabic Level of Dialectness of Text,"As implied by our previous experiment, the Token DI model acts as a sentence level DI model, tagging all the tokens as dialectal if only one token shows a distinctive dialectal feature.

Because BOOOOKSCORE does not rely on gold summaries, it can easily be used to evaluate new LLM summarizers on any collection of newly-published books, ensuring that the metric will remain meaningful for LLMs of the future.","We created an AI evaluation system named BOOOOKSCORE to detect and clarify occurrences of any of the 8 coherence mistakes we defined earlier in summaries.

(2021) were among the first to prove that adversaries can implement training data extraction attacks on language models, like GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019), to obtain detailed information from training examples, including personally identifiable information.

Improved Techniques for Training Consistency Models," We can train consistency models using either consistency distillation (CD) or consistency training (CT). The former requires pre-training a diffusion model and distilling the knowledge therein into a consistency model. The latter allows us to train consistency models directly from data, establishing them as an independent family of generative models. Previous work (Song et al., 2023) demonstrates that CD significantly outperforms CT. However, CD adds computational overhead to the training process since it requires learning a separate diffusion model. Additionally, distillation limits the sample quality of the consistency model to that of the diffusion model.","We have two options for teaching consistency models - consistency distillation (CD) or consistency training (CT). CD means first pre-educating a diffusion model and moving that knowledge into a consistency model.

However, CD makes training more complex since we have to build a separate diffusion model. Also, distillation restricts the consistency model's sample quality to the diffusion model's level.","There are two ways to develop consistency models - consistency distillation (CD) or consistency training (CT). CD requires first constructing a diffusion model and transferring its knowledge to a consistency model. CT enables directly training consistency models from scratch as their own generative model family. Past work (Song et al., 2023) proves CD greatly surpasses CT in performance. But CD adds computational burden during training by needing a distinct diffusion model. And distillation limits the consistency model's sample quality to that of the diffusion model.  ","We have two approaches for instilling consistency models - consistency distillation (CD) or consistency training (CT). The former necessitates first forming a diffusion model and infusing its expertise into a consistency model. The latter permits directly cultivating consistency models from the ground up as their own generative model type. Earlier research (Song et al., 2023) validates CD substantially excels over CT. However, CD increases computational load during training through requiring a separate diffusion model. Additionally, distillation confines the consistency model's sample quality to the diffusion model's benchmark.",A,0

It is worth noting that the presence of large Lipschitz constants can have a more detrimental impact on the efficiency of fast sampling compared to full-timestep sampling, as numerical solvers typically depend on the similarity between function values and their derivatives on adjacent steps. When using fast sampling algorithms with larger discretization steps, it becomes necessary for the functions to exhibit better smoothness, which in turn corresponds to smaller Lipschitz constants. Hence, it is anticipated that the utilization of ETSDM will lead to an improvement in the generation performance of fast sampling methods.","As fast sampling techniques like DDIM (Song et al., 2020) and DPM-Solver (Lu et al., 2022b) have matured, integrating E-TSDM with these classic fast sampling methods has become imperative.

At each generation step, the model only needs to encode the newly generated tokens from the last step. Furthermore, after a new token being generated, its associated key and value vectors are appended to the current KV cache. Consequently, the KV cache’s size experiences a linear surge in tandem with the generation of additional tokens.","When the initial encoding of the prompt ends, large language models start creating tokens one by one. At each point where a new token is made, the model just has to encode the tokens created since the last step.

We summed up the outcomes in Table 3. Our present order (as in Equation 2) accomplishes both the highest win paces and pruned proportions.  ","As before in Part 3.4, we utilized a basic methodology to assemble a versatile KV store. Here, we inspect how changing the arrangement of applying each strategy influences the execution.

Model Tells you what to Discard - Adaptive KV Cache Compression for LLMs,"We analyze the sensitivity of FastGen against the hyper-parameters, as illustrated in Figure 6.

Neural Fine-Tuning Search for Few-Shot Learning,"Fine-tuning approaches to few-shot adaptation must manage a trade-off between adapting a large or small number of parameters. The former allows for better adaptation, but risks overfitting on a few-shot training set. The latter reduces the risk of overfitting, but limits the capacity for adaptation to novel categories and domains. The recent PMF (Hu et al., 2022) manages this trade-off through careful tuning of learning rates while fine-tuning the entire feature extractor.

Neural Fine-Tuning Search for Few-Shot Learning,"Most importantly, both variants of our NFTS substantially outperform the baselines, demonstrating the value of our overall framework compared to mainstream fixed fine-tuning patterns. Next, we can compare our top-1 adaptation architecture selection strategy against our progressive approach that defers the final architecture selection to an episode-wise decision (i.e., NFTS-1 vs. NFTS-N). Our deferred architecture selection improves upon fixing the top-1 architecture from meta-train, especially for the single source domain case. This is intuitive, because NAS on a single source domain (cf., multi-domain) condition is most at risk of over-tuning to that domain, and should benefit the most from learning and transferring a diverse pool of architectures to the target domains.","Most significantly, our two versions of the NFTS model considerably surpass the baseline models, showing the value of our general framework over typical fixed fine-tuning approaches. Furthermore, we can contrast our technique of selecting the top architecture from meta-training to our progressive tactic which delays the final architecture choice to a per-episode decision (NFTS-1 vs. NFTS-N). Putting off the architecture selection improves on fixing the top meta-training architecture, especially for adapting from a single source domain. This makes sense, as NAS with just one source domain (vs. multiple) is most prone to over-fitting that domain, so should benefit most from learning and transferring a diverse set of architectures to the target domains.","In summary, both forms of our NFTS model substantially outdo the baseline models, demonstrating the superiority of our framework compared to conventional fixed fine-tuning methods. In addition, we can compare our approach of choosing the top-ranked architecture from meta-training to our gradual tactic that postpones the final architecture decision to a per-episode selection (NFTS-1 vs. NFTS-N). Delaying the architecture pick improves on locking in the top meta-training architecture, particularly for adapting from a solitary source domain. This is logical, because NAS with a single source domain (versus multiple) is most susceptible to over-specializing to that domain, so should profit most from learning and transferring a diverse collection of architectures to the target domains.","Above all, both versions of our NFTS model considerably eclipse the baseline models, exhibiting the advantages of our framework over typical static fine-tuning techniques. Moreover, we can contrast our strategy of selecting the highest-ranked architecture from meta-training to our incremental approach that puts off the final architecture choice to a per-episode decision (NFTS-1 vs. NFTS-N). Postponing the architecture selection enhances fixing the top meta-training architecture, especially for adapting from a single source domain.
